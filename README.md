# NFT Viewer
Viewer for Purpose's Combined Standup Activity

## Installation

To have MetaMask and the NFT Viewer working, you need to run a local server. You can do this by running the following command in the root directory of the project:
```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
```
OR

```bash
npm install -g http-server
http-server -p 8000
```
